github-repository: https://github.com/0rka0/TourPlanner

The tourplanner is empty from the beginning.
Setting up the application requires the user to create the tables defined in the DatabaseScript beforehand.
After the application is up and running Data can be either manually added by using the functionaility of 
the application or the TourData.json file can be imported to import a set of predefined tours.
